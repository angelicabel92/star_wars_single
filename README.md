# Star Wars single page
A star wars single page of characters

Used Next.js to construct the app and NextUI for components.
also add the jest configuration for add tests but I didn't have time to finish them.

I normally use BEM for SCC but this time I wanted to test the module styles. 
also I wanted to try the SWR to do the fetch.
and add the lint and prettier for improve the code.

# Inicialize
for initialize the project in local run the script 'next dev'
# Next Steps

Complete the test
Fix the UI
Improve the detail view for recharge
Create error component for visualize better the error

# Extras
I found a error of secuency in the API, the character 17 doesnt exist so the secuency cant be automatically so I have to fixed with a function.
